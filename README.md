Info: Hello sir, I here is my submission for the blood donor exercise for Forum 3.

P.S.: I couldnt figure out how to do exactly what was told in the description of the Forum so I chaged it a little bit. Instead of using only canGiveBlood(a,b) for every bloodtype,
Instead I use canGiveBloodA(a,b), canGiveBloodB(a,b), canGiveBloodAB(a,b), canGiveBloodO(a,b) for the keywords. The bloodtype letters represent the "a" parameter, so in order for it
to work as intended you will have to input the same bloodtype in the "a" parameter slot. For example: canGiveBloodA can only accept "A-" or "A+" in the "a" parameter slot and it is
also true for the other functions.
